# Mini-Projects
This is a general dump of my mini projects along my journey to learning coding. Most of them will be in Python but as I branch out they should start to use different languages.

Please take into account that I am a beginner and will almost never have the best or most efficient code. However, I am always open to suggestions for improvement as long as they come wtih explanations to help me learn.
